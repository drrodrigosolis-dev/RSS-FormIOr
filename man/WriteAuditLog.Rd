\description{
This writes a small CSV/TSV log of key actions (e.g., downloads, cleaning,
exports). It is designed to be easy for non-technical users to open in Excel.
If you are using automatic logging, you generally do not need to call this
directly; it is used behind the scenes by other FormIOr functions.
