\title{Identify columns with multiple distinct values per submission}
\usage{
findMultilines(x, id_col = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list returned by \code{\link[=FlattenSubmissions]{FlattenSubmissions()}}, containing at minimum
\verb{$FlatResponses} (the flattened data frame) and optionally \verb{$ColumnNames}.}

\item{id_col}{Integer. The column number that contains the unique submission
identifier (usually \code{submissionId}). Default = 1 (first column).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the \strong{same dimensions and column names} as
\code{x$FlatResponses}, but where (starting from the second column) every cell
contains the count of distinct non-NA values in that column for the given
submission. Counts = 1 indicate constant/single-value fields; counts > 1
indicate multi-value fields that are likely causing duplicated rows.
}
\description{
Creates a diagnostic data frame with the same shape as the flattened responses,
where each original value (except in the ID column) is replaced by the number
of \strong{distinct non-NA values} that appear in that column for the corresponding
submission. This makes it easy to detect which questions/fields caused row
duplication due to repeated sections, multi-select choices, or repeating groups.
}
\details{
This function is typically used before \code{\link[=FixDups]{FixDups()}} to help non-technical users
identify which columns need special handling (e.g. concatenate, pick first,
sum, pivot wider, etc.).
If audit logging is active (see \code{\link[=StartAuditLog]{StartAuditLog()}}), this action is recorded.

Columns that are constant within each submission will show \code{1} everywhere
(or \code{NA} if the column is entirely missing for that submission).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
flat <- FlattenSubmissions(GetResponses(form_id = "123", api_key = "abc..."))

# See which columns have multiple values per submission
multi_counts <- findMultilines(flat)

# Quick check: which columns ever have more than one distinct value?
multi_counts |>
  summarise(across(-1, ~ max(.x, na.rm = TRUE))) |>
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "column", values_to = "max_distinct") |>
  filter(max_distinct > 1)
}
