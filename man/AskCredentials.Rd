This is usually called automatically by \code{\link[=GetResponses]{GetResponses()}} and related
functions when credentials are not already stored.

If audit logging is active (see \code{\link[=StartAuditLog]{StartAuditLog()}}), the action is recorded,
but the credentials themselves are \strong{not} written to the log.

\section{CHEF credentials and base URL}{

FormIOr is designed for the BC Public Service CHEF FormIO service.
The default base URL is \verb{https://submit.digital.gov.bc.ca/app/api/v1}.
If you use a different FormIO service, you must override \code{base_url} in
\code{\link[=GetResponses]{GetResponses()}} / \code{\link[=GetSubmissions]{GetSubmissions()}}, and compatibility is not guaranteed.

For CHEF users, generate your API key from the form's \strong{Manage} page.
The Form ID is the final alphanumeric code after the \code{=} sign in the
Manage page URL.
