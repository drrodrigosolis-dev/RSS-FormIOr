\title{Flatten nested FormIO submissions into a single table}
\usage{
FlattenSubmissions(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame or list of submissions, typically returned by
\code{\link[=GetResponses]{GetResponses()}}.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{FlatResponses}{A flattened data frame (one row per submission row in the source).}
\item{ColumnNames}{A data frame listing the new column names and their order.}
}
}
\description{
FormIO submissions often contain nested lists (for repeating sections,
address blocks, uploads, etc.). \code{FlattenSubmissions()} expands those nested
structures into a regular 2D data frame so you can export and analyze the
data more easily.
}
\details{
Nested columns are flattened using their parent name as a prefix, then a
\code{"-"} separator, and then the nested field name.
If audit logging is active (see \code{\link[=StartAuditLog]{StartAuditLog()}}), this action is recorded.
}
\examples{
x <- FoodTypes

# Flattened structure
xFlat <- FlattenSubmissions(x)
head(xFlat$FlatResponses)
head(xFlat$ColumnNames)
}
