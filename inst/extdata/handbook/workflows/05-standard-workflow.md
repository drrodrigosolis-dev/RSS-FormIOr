# Page 5: Standard Workflow (Download -> Clean -> Export)

[Home](../index.md) | [Prev: Security and Credentials](../rationale/04-security-credentials.md) | [Next: Manual Diagnostics](06-manual-diagnostics.md)

This is the recommended manual workflow when you do not want to use the wizard.
It is structured to be repeatable and easy to audit.

### Step-by-step explanation

1. Download responses using the FormIO export API
2. Flatten nested columns into a clean table
3. Normalize column names for readability
4. Identify the submission ID column
5. Resolve repeated answers (one row per submission)
6. Export to Excel and optionally create a codebook

### Example

```r
responses <- GetResponses(form_id = "your-form-id", api_key = "your-api-key")
flat <- FlattenSubmissions(responses)

norm <- NormalizeColumnNames(flat, return_flat = TRUE, quiet = TRUE)
flat <- norm$flat

id_col <- "form_submissionid"

resolved <- ResolveRepeats(flat, id_col = id_col, return_flat = TRUE, quiet = TRUE)
flat <- resolved$flat

codebook <- MakeCodebook(flat, quiet = TRUE)
sheets <- list(Responses = flat$FlatResponses, Codebook = codebook)
ExportToExcel(sheets, path = "FormIOr_output.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)
```

### When to use this

- You want full control over each step
- You are building a script for repeatable reporting
- You do not want interactive prompts
