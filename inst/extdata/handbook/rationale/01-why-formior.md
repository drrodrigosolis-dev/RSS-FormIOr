# Page 1: Why FormIOr Exists

[Home](../index.md) | [Next: Core Concepts](02-core-concepts.md)

FormIOr exists to solve a common problem: FormIO data is powerful, but the
structure can be difficult for non-technical teams to work with. Exports often
contain nested lists, repeated sections, and multiple rows per submission. The
result is that simple reporting tasks take far too long or become inconsistent
across teams.

FormIOr provides a repeatable path from raw responses to clean, analysis-ready
outputs. It is designed for teams who need to share data with program leads,
analysts, or partners who may only be comfortable with Excel. That is why the
package focuses on clear naming, readable codebooks, and a multi-sheet export
workbook that captures both raw and cleaned data.

A second goal is transparency. When data is cleaned or transformed, those
changes should be recorded. FormIOr includes audit logging and a wizard that
saves the exact steps taken. This makes it easier to explain and reproduce
results over time.

This package and handbook are maintained by **Rodrigo Solis-Sosa, PhD**,
Human Dimensions of Wildlife Specialist, BC Ministry of Water, Land and
Resource Stewardship.

Key design goals:

- Make FormIO data usable by non-technical staff
- Encourage repeatable, documented workflows
- Reduce errors caused by manual copy/paste steps
- Provide outputs that are safe to share

If your team needs to produce consistent monthly or quarterly reports from
FormIO, FormIOr is meant to be the "one workflow" you can return to.
