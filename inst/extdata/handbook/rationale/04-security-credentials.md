# Page 4: Security and Credentials

[Home](../index.md) | [Prev: Getting Started](03-getting-started.md) | [Next: Standard Workflow](../workflows/05-standard-workflow.md)

FormIOr does not store API keys on disk. Credentials are kept only in memory for
the current R session. This is important for safety and compliance.

You can provide credentials directly in function calls:

```r
responses <- fetch_form_responses(form_id = "your-form-id", api_key = "your-api-key")
```

Or enter them interactively if prompted. The credentials are stored in memory
only and are not written to the audit log.

You can also pre-load credentials explicitly to skip prompts:

```r
ask_credentials(form_id = "your-form-id", api = "your-api-key")
responses <- fetch_form_responses()  # reuses cached credentials for this session
```

Tips:

- Do not paste credentials into shared scripts.
- Use environment variables if you need automated runs.
- Restarting R clears stored credentials.

If you are using CHEF (BC Public Service FormIO), see the next page for
screenshots showing where to obtain your API key and Form ID. The default
CHEF base URL used by FormIOr is:

```
https://submit.digital.gov.bc.ca/app/api/v1
```

Note (CHEF): Metadata/schema endpoints may live at `/api/v1`. FormIOr will
automatically retry the alternate base for metadata/schema requests when needed.
