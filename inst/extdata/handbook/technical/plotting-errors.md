# Plotting Error Handling

Plotting can fail if a chosen column is the wrong type or contains
unexpected values. The wizard is designed to capture errors and continue.

## How errors are handled

- Each plot is attempted independently
- Errors are caught and recorded
- The wizard prints a short message and moves on

## What you can do

- Choose columns that match the plot type (numeric vs categorical)
- Use the default suggested columns if unsure
- Inspect warnings in the console or audit log
