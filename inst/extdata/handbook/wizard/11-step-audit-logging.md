# Page 11: Step 2 - Audit Logging

Start a new audit log or reuse an existing one. The audit log records every major action in the workflow.

## What you will be asked

You will see a short prompt with a recommended default. Press Enter to
accept the default or provide a new value if you need to change it.

## Why this step matters

This step keeps your workflow consistent and makes the output easier to
share and reproduce across runs.

## Tips

- Recommend enabling logging for all runs
- If an audit log is not active, the wizard will ask to start one
- Audit logs are saved as CSV for easy review
