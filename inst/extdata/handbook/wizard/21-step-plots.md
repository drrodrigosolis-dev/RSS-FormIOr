# Page 21: Step 12 - Plots

Generate diagnostic plots such as histograms or bar charts. Users can select which plots to create and which columns to use.

## What you will be asked

You will see a short prompt with a recommended default. Press Enter to
accept the default or provide a new value if you need to change it.

## Why this step matters

This step keeps your workflow consistent and makes the output easier to
share and reproduce across runs.

## Tips

- Errors are captured so the wizard does not stop
- Use suggested columns or choose your own
- Plots are saved to the output folder
