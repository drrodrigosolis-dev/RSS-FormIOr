# Page 16: Step 7 - Deduplicate Submissions

Optionally keep only the latest record for each submission ID.

## What you will be asked

You will see a short prompt with a recommended default. Press Enter to
accept the default or provide a new value if you need to change it.

## Why this step matters

This step keeps your workflow consistent and makes the output easier to
share and reproduce across runs.

## Tips

- Use when submissions are updated or resubmitted
- If you need all versions, skip this step
- Deduplication is logged with counts
