# Page 17: Step 8 - Resolve Repeated Answers

Collapse repeated answers within each submission so each field has a single value.

## What you will be asked

You will see a short prompt with a recommended default. Press Enter to
accept the default or provide a new value if you need to change it.

## Why this step matters

This step keeps your workflow consistent and makes the output easier to
share and reproduce across runs.

## Tips

- Useful for checkbox-style questions
- Values are combined using safe defaults
- Errors are caught and logged so the wizard continues
