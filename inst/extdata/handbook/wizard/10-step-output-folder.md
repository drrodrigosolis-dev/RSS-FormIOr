# Page 10: Step 1 - Output Folder and Files

Choose or confirm where outputs will be saved. The wizard creates a run-specific folder, prints the path, and uses it as the default for all outputs.

## What you will be asked

You will see a short prompt with a recommended default. Press Enter to
accept the default or provide a new value if you need to change it.

## Why this step matters

This step keeps your workflow consistent and makes the output easier to
share and reproduce across runs.

## Tips

- Accept the suggested folder for consistent naming
- If you choose a custom path, keep it in a writable location
- The folder name should include the form name and date/time
