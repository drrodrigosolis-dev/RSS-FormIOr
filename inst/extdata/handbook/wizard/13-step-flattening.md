# Page 13: Step 4 - Flattening

Convert nested submission structures into a flat data.frame. This makes the data ready for cleaning and export.

## What you will be asked

You will see a short prompt with a recommended default. Press Enter to
accept the default or provide a new value if you need to change it.

## Why this step matters

This step keeps your workflow consistent and makes the output easier to
share and reproduce across runs.

## Tips

- Flattening preserves submission IDs
- Nested repeats become multi-value fields
- Keep a copy of the raw flattened data for reference
