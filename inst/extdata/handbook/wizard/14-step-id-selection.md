# Page 14: Step 5 - Submission ID Selection

Select or confirm which column represents the submission ID. This ID is used for deduplication and targeted adjustments.

## What you will be asked

You will see a short prompt with a recommended default. Press Enter to
accept the default or provide a new value if you need to change it.

## Why this step matters

This step keeps your workflow consistent and makes the output easier to
share and reproduce across runs.

## Tips

- Use the form submission ID when available
- If you normalize column names, the ID field name will change
- All later steps assume the ID is unique
